            <h3>More About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I went to college for two years for computer science, but due to personal complications I was not able to continue. I love to play video games and code on my free time. I am a big sports fan and workout to keep myself healthy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member or a leader of a team. I especially enjoy working with changing projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but high precision. I am sociable but also known for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming or designing.
